      "habitatRequirements": "Samuels Song Sparrows are an abundant resident in salt marshes in their described distribution. In a typical San Pablo Bay marsh, sparrow territories are lined single file every 10 to 50 m along channels, providing each pair with access to the slough and its associated tall vegetation for song perches and nesting cover. Dense vegetation is required for nesting sites for all Song Sparrows. Where vegetation is too short and sparse, Samuels Song Sparrows nests are more likely to be exposed to predators or flooding during high tides. The dominant plants of tidal salt marshes in San Pablo Bay, which may be used in the construction of nests, are California Cord Grass (Spartina foliosa) in low elevations, Pickleweed (Salicornia virginica) at higher elevations, and Gumplant (Grindelia stricta) on the highest ground along slough edges and levees.",

      "speciesDescription": "Wood storks are large, long-legged wading birds, about 5O inches tall, with a wingspan of 60 to 65 inches. The plumage is white except for black primaries and secondaries and a short black tail. The head and neck are largely unfeathered and dark gray in color. The bill is black, thick at the base, and slightly decurved. Immature birds are dingy gray and have a yellowish bill. \n",
      "habitatRequirements": "The southeast United States breeding population of the wood stork declined from an estimated 20,000 pairs in the 1930's to about 10,000 pairs by 1960, and to a low of approximately 5,000 pairs in the late 1970s.  Nesting primarily occurred in the Everglades.  The generally accepted explanation for the decline of the wood stork is the reduction in food base (primarly small fish) necessary to support breeding colonies.  This reduction is attributed to loss of wetland habitat as well as to changes in water hydroperiods from draining wetlands and changing water regimes by constructing levees, canals, and floodgates to alter water flow in south Florida.\n\nWood storks have a unique feeding technique and require higher prey concentrations than other wading birds.  Optimal water regimes for the wood stork involve periods of flooding, during which prey (fish) populations increase, alternating with dryer periods, during which receding water levels concentrate fish at higher densities coinciding with the stork's nesting season.  Loss of nesting habitat (primarily cypress swamps) may be affecting wood storks in central Florida, where nesting in non-native trees and in man-made impoundments has been occurring recently.  Less significant factors known to affect nesting success include prolonged drought and flooding, raccoon predation on nests, and human disturbance of rookeries.",

Hind feet have four toes and its laterally white-striped, thick tail has a conspicuous white tuft of hair on the tip and is about 160 percent of the length of the body (Merriam 1894, p. 110) (Figure 2.1). OrdÂ’s kangaroo rat, (Dipodomys ordii), the only other kangaroo rat in the TKR range, is smaller, lacks the long white hairs at the tip of the tail, has five toes on the hind feet, and lives in sandy soil uncharacteristic of TKR habitat (Dalquest and Collier 1964, p. 148; Martin 2002, p. 2). Like other Dipodomys spp., both male and female TKR possess skin glands dorsally between the shoulders, which communicate sexual receptivity (Stangl et al. 2006, p. 466). The body is relatively large averaging 120 millimeters (mm) (4.7 inches (in)) in length. The upper body is a pale yellow-brown color with blackish guard hairs and the underside of the animal is white. The nearly hairless ears are small and the eyes relatively large. The sexes are superficially indistinguishable (Strassman 2004, p. 2); however, males may be generally larger than females, especially on the eastern and western margins of their range (Best 1987, p. 57). External measurements average: total length, 317 mm (12.5 in); tail, 196 mm (7.7 in); hind foot, 46 mm (1.8 in) (Schmidly 2004, p. 366). TKR use their long hind feet for saltatorial (jumping) locomotion and escaping predators (Genoways and Brown 1993, p. 297).",
      "habitatRequirements": "Habitat that supports the Texas kangaroo rat's life history generally includes an accumulation of loose, friable soil, usually associated with a minor topographic uplift (e.g., prairie mounds) or physical support, including woody vegetation (e.g., roots of shrubs and cacti) and other natural (e.g., rocks, upturned rootballs) or manmade structures. A common characteristic of TKR habitat is the presence of bare ground and short grasses, often expressed as a lack of dense vegetation. The TKR digs a subterranean burrow system within loam/clay-loam/sandy-loam soils with multiple chambers branching from the main tunnel, which are used for shelter, reproduction, and food storage. Resource needs for individual TKR generally include: friable, loam/clay-loam soil for burrowing, predominately grasses and forbs for a food source, short grass prairie with bare ground and limited woody cover, and topographic relief not prone to flooding events.\r\n",

      "speciesDescription": "Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) are generally larger and heavier than other bears. Adult males average 200 to 300 kilograms (kg) (400 to 600 pounds (lb)) and adult females 110 to 160 kg (250 to 350 lb) in the lower-48 States. Their coloration varies from light brown to nearly black. They can be distinguished from black bears by longer, less curved front claws, humped shoulders, and a facial profile that appears concace. The coat features longer guard hairs over a dense underfur with tips that are usually silver or golden in color Â– hence the name Â“grizzly.Â” Grizzly bears are long-lived mammals, generally living into their mid- to late-20s, although some wild bears have lived for over 35 years. Grizzly bears are a member of the brown bear species (U. arctos) that occurs in North America, Europe, and Asia. The subspecies U. a. horribilis is limited to North America and historically existed throughout much of the western half of the lower-48 States, central Mexico, western Canada, and most of Alaska. Prior to 1800, an estimated 50,000 grizzly bears were distributed in one large contiguous area throughout all or portions of 18 the westernmost States. Grizzly bears were probably most common in the Rocky Mountains, along the Upper Missouri River, and in California. Grizzly bears were less common or did not occur in large expanses of the North American deserts and Great Plains ecoregions. With the arrival of Europeans to North America, grizzly bears were seen as a threat to livestock and human safety and, therefore, an impediment to westward expansion and settlement. In the 1800s, in concert with European settlement of the American West and government-funded bounty programs aimed at eradication, grizzly bears were shot, poisoned, and trapped wherever they were found. The resulting declines in range and population were dramatic with rapid extinction of populations from Mexico and most of the central and southwestern United States and California. Grizzly bears were reduced to close to 2 percent of their former range in the lower-48 States by the 1930s, with a corresponding decrease in population. By 1975, grizzly bear populations in the lower-48 States had been reduced in number to 700Â–800 and restricted largely to the confines of National Parks and Wilderness areas in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. The 1993 Recovery Plan identified six ecosystems, with recovery zones at the core of each, to further recovery efforts. Each recovery zone represents an area large enough and of sufficient habitat quality to support a recovered grizzly bear population. The Recovery Plan recognized that grizzly bears will move and reside permanently in areas outside the recovery zones and that movement between recovery areas would be necessary for isolated populations to increase and sustain themselves at recovery levels. The recovery zones identified are: (1) the Greater Yellowstone (GYE) in northwestern Wyoming, eastern Idaho, and southwestern Montana; (2) the Northern Continental Divide (NCDE) of north-central Montana; (3) the North Cascades area of north-central Washington; (4) the Selkirks (SE) area of northern Idaho, northeast Washington, and southeast B.C.; (5) the Cabinet-Yaak (CYE) area of northwestern Montana and northern Idaho; and (6) the Bitterroot (BE) in the Bitterroot Mountains of central Idaho and western Montana. Currently, there are at least 1,913 individuals in the lower-48 States (737 in the GYE demographic monitoring area, 1,068 in the NCDE, 55Â–60 in the CYE, and a minimum of 53 in the U.S. portion of the SE, although some bears have home ranges that cross the international border). In addition, grizzly bears have been verified in areas outside of current distributions; however, there are likely few resident grizzly bears in the lower-48 States outside of the GYE, NCDE, CYE, and SE. There are currently no known populations within the North Cascades and BE.",
      "habitatRequirements": "Grizzly bears use a variety of habitats.  In general, a grizzly bearÂ’s individual habitat needs and daily movements are largely driven by the search for food, water, mates, cover, security, or den sites.  The available habitat for bears is also influenced by people and their activities.  Human activities are the primary factor impacting habitat security and the ability of bears to find and access foods, mates, cover, and den sites.  Other factors influencing habitat use and function for grizzly bears include overall habitat productivity (e.g., food distribution, quality, and abundance), the availability of habitat components (e.g., denning areas, cover types), grizzly bear social dynamics, learned behavior and preferences of individual grizzly bears, grizzly bear population density, and random variation.  Water is an important habitat requirement; however, we have no information to suggest that water is limiting in the habitat that bears currently occupy, but may have limited distribution in portions of historical range.\r\n\r\nGrizzly bears use a variety of cover types to rest and shelter.  Grizzly bears often select bed sites with horizontal and vertical cover, especially at day bed sites suggesting that bed site selection is important for concealment from humans.  The interspersion of open areas as feeding sites associated with cover are important, probably because diverse habitat complexes, such as forest interspersed with moist grass-forb meadows, provide both abundant food and cover.  Generally, areas with vegetative cover are important to grizzly bears for use as bedding sites.  Beds underneath any type of vegetative cover (not necessarily always forest cover) provide bears shade during the hottest parts of the day and a place to sleep at night.\r\n\r\nThe six ecosystems occur in mountainous ecoregions and each ecosystem provide the habitat heterogeneity necessary for adequate food, denning, and cover resources.  Because there are limited opportunities to increase or control these habitat components, the objective for grizzly bear habitat management has been and continues to be to reduce or mitigate the risk of human-caused mortality and displacement.  An effective habitat management tool for reducing grizzly bear mortality risk on public lands is managing motorized access to ensure bears have secure areas away from humans.  Unmanaged motorized access:  (1) increases human interaction and potential grizzly bear mortality risk; (2) increases displacement from important habitat; (3) increases habituation to humans; and (4) decreases habitat where energetic (i.e., food) requirements can be met.  Managing motorized access on public lands helps ameliorate these impacts.  Other habitat management tools that minimize displacement and reduce grizzly bear mortality risk include regulating livestock allotments and developed sites on public lands.  Implementing food storage orders on public lands also reduces mortality risk for both humans and grizzly bears.  Requiring users and recreationists in grizzly bear habitat to store their food, garbage, and other bear attractants so that they are inaccessible to bears reduces encounters and human-grizzly bear conflicts.  In addition, encouraging users and recreationists to carry bear spray and know how to use it helps reduce the potential for injury to people and bears. ",

      "habitatRequirements": "Samuels Song Sparrows are an abundant resident in salt marshes in their described distribution. In a typical San Pablo Bay marsh, sparrow territories are lined single file every 10 to 50 m along channels, providing each pair with access to the slough and its associated tall vegetation for song perches and nesting cover. Dense vegetation is required for nesting sites for all Song Sparrows. Where vegetation is too short and sparse, Samuels Song Sparrows nests are more likely to be exposed to predators or flooding during high tides. The dominant plants of tidal salt marshes in San Pablo Bay, which may be used in the construction of nests, are California Cord Grass (Spartina foliosa) in low elevations, Pickleweed (Salicornia virginica) at higher elevations, and Gumplant (Grindelia stricta) on the highest ground along slough edges and levees.",

The plumage is white except for black primaries and secondaries and a short black tail. The head and neck are largely unfeathered and dark gray in color. The bill is black, thick at the base, and slightly decurved. Immature birds are dingy gray and have a yellowish bill. \n",
      "habitatRequirements": "The southeast United States breeding population of the wood stork declined from an estimated 20,000 pairs in the 1930's to about 10,000 pairs by 1960, and to a low of approximately 5,000 pairs in the late 1970s.  Nesting primarily occurred in the Everglades.  The generally accepted explanation for the decline of the wood stork is the reduction in food base (primarly small fish) necessary to support breeding colonies.  This reduction is attributed to loss of wetland habitat as well as to changes in water hydroperiods from draining wetlands and changing water regimes by constructing levees, canals, and floodgates to alter water flow in south Florida.\n\nWood storks have a unique feeding technique and require higher prey concentrations than other wading birds.  Optimal water regimes for the wood stork involve periods of flooding, during which prey (fish) populations increase, alternating with dryer periods, during which receding water levels concentrate fish at higher densities coinciding with the stork's nesting season.  Loss of nesting habitat (primarily cypress swamps) may be affecting wood storks in central Florida, where nesting in non-native trees and in man-made impoundments has been occurring recently.  Less significant factors known to affect nesting success include prolonged drought and flooding, raccoon predation on nests, and human disturbance of rookeries.",

Hind feet have four toes and its laterally white-striped, thick tail has a conspicuous white tuft of hair on the tip and is about 160 percent of the length of the body (Merriam 1894, p. 110) (Figure 2.1). OrdÂ’s kangaroo rat, (Dipodomys ordii), the only other kangaroo rat in the TKR range, is smaller, lacks the long white hairs at the tip of the tail, has five toes on the hind feet, and lives in sandy soil uncharacteristic of TKR habitat (Dalquest and Collier 1964, p. 148; Martin 2002, p. 2). Like other Dipodomys spp., both male and female TKR possess skin glands dorsally between the shoulders, which communicate sexual receptivity (Stangl et al. 2006, p. 466). The body is relatively large averaging 120 millimeters (mm) (4.7 inches (in)) in length. The upper body is a pale yellow-brown color with blackish guard hairs and the underside of the animal is white. The nearly hairless ears are small and the eyes relatively large. The sexes are superficially indistinguishable (Strassman 2004, p. 2); however, males may be generally larger than females, especially on the eastern and western margins of their range (Best 1987, p. 57). External measurements average: total length, 317 mm (12.5 in); tail, 196 mm (7.7 in); hind foot, 46 mm (1.8 in) (Schmidly 2004, p. 366). TKR use their long hind feet for saltatorial (jumping) locomotion and escaping predators (Genoways and Brown 1993, p. 297).",
      "habitatRequirements": "Habitat that supports the Texas kangaroo rat's life history generally includes an accumulation of loose, friable soil, usually associated with a minor topographic uplift (e.g., prairie mounds) or physical support, including woody vegetation (e.g., roots of shrubs and cacti) and other natural (e.g., rocks, upturned rootballs) or manmade structures. A common characteristic of TKR habitat is the presence of bare ground and short grasses, often expressed as a lack of dense vegetation. The TKR digs a subterranean burrow system within loam/clay-loam/sandy-loam soils with multiple chambers branching from the main tunnel, which are used for shelter, reproduction, and food storage. Resource needs for individual TKR generally include: friable, loam/clay-loam soil for burrowing, predominately grasses and forbs for a food source, short grass prairie with bare ground and limited woody cover, and topographic relief not prone to flooding events.\r\n",

      "speciesDescription": "Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) are generally larger and heavier than other bears. Adult males average 200 to 300 kilograms (kg) (400 to 600 pounds (lb)) and adult females 110 to 160 kg (250 to 350 lb) in the lower-48 States. Their coloration varies from light brown to nearly black. They can be distinguished from black bears by longer, less curved front claws, humped shoulders, and a facial profile that appears concace. The coat features longer guard hairs over a dense underfur with tips that are usually silver or golden in color Â– hence the name Â“grizzly.Â” Grizzly bears are long-lived mammals, generally living into their mid- to late-20s, although some wild bears have lived for over 35 years. Grizzly bears are a member of the brown bear species (U. arctos) that occurs in North America, Europe, and Asia. The subspecies U. a. horribilis is limited to North America and historically existed throughout much of the western half of the lower-48 States, central Mexico, western Canada, and most of Alaska. Prior to 1800, an estimated 50,000 grizzly bears were distributed in one large contiguous area throughout all or portions of 18 the westernmost States. Grizzly bears were probably most common in the Rocky Mountains, along the Upper Missouri River, and in California. Grizzly bears were less common or did not occur in large expanses of the North American deserts and Great Plains ecoregions. With the arrival of Europeans to North America, grizzly bears were seen as a threat to livestock and human safety and, therefore, an impediment to westward expansion and settlement. In the 1800s, in concert with European settlement of the American West and government-funded bounty programs aimed at eradication, grizzly bears were shot, poisoned, and trapped wherever they were found. The resulting declines in range and population were dramatic with rapid extinction of populations from Mexico and most of the central and southwestern United States and California. Grizzly bears were reduced to close to 2 percent of their former range in the lower-48 States by the 1930s, with a corresponding decrease in population. By 1975, grizzly bear populations in the lower-48 States had been reduced in number to 700Â–800 and restricted largely to the confines of National Parks and Wilderness areas in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. The 1993 Recovery Plan identified six ecosystems, with recovery zones at the core of each, to further recovery efforts. Each recovery zone represents an area large enough and of sufficient habitat quality to support a recovered grizzly bear population. The Recovery Plan recognized that grizzly bears will move and reside permanently in areas outside the recovery zones and that movement between recovery areas would be necessary for isolated populations to increase and sustain themselves at recovery levels. The recovery zones identified are: (1) the Greater Yellowstone (GYE) in northwestern Wyoming, eastern Idaho, and southwestern Montana; (2) the Northern Continental Divide (NCDE) of north-central Montana; (3) the North Cascades area of north-central Washington; (4) the Selkirks (SE) area of northern Idaho, northeast Washington, and southeast B.C.; (5) the Cabinet-Yaak (CYE) area of northwestern Montana and northern Idaho; and (6) the Bitterroot (BE) in the Bitterroot Mountains of central Idaho and western Montana. Currently, there are at least 1,913 individuals in the lower-48 States (737 in the GYE demographic monitoring area, 1,068 in the NCDE, 55Â–60 in the CYE, and a minimum of 53 in the U.S. portion of the SE, although some bears have home ranges that cross the international border). In addition, grizzly bears have been verified in areas outside of current distributions; however, there are likely few resident grizzly bears in the lower-48 States outside of the GYE, NCDE, CYE, and SE. There are currently no known populations within the North Cascades and BE.",
      "habitatRequirements": "Grizzly bears use a variety of habitats.  In general, a grizzly bearÂ’s individual habitat needs and daily movements are largely driven by the search for food, water, mates, cover, security, or den sites.  The available habitat for bears is also influenced by people and their activities.  Human activities are the primary factor impacting habitat security and the ability of bears to find and access foods, mates, cover, and den sites.  Other factors influencing habitat use and function for grizzly bears include overall habitat productivity (e.g., food distribution, quality, and abundance), the availability of habitat components (e.g., denning areas, cover types), grizzly bear social dynamics, learned behavior and preferences of individual grizzly bears, grizzly bear population density, and random variation.  Water is an important habitat requirement; however, we have no information to suggest that water is limiting in the habitat that bears currently occupy, but may have limited distribution in portions of historical range.\r\n\r\nGrizzly bears use a variety of cover types to rest and shelter.  Grizzly bears often select bed sites with horizontal and vertical cover, especially at day bed sites suggesting that bed site selection is important for concealment from humans.  The interspersion of open areas as feeding sites associated with cover are important, probably because diverse habitat complexes, such as forest interspersed with moist grass-forb meadows, provide both abundant food and cover.  Generally, areas with vegetative cover are important to grizzly bears for use as bedding sites.  Beds underneath any type of vegetative cover (not necessarily always forest cover) provide bears shade during the hottest parts of the day and a place to sleep at night.\r\n\r\nThe six ecosystems occur in mountainous ecoregions and each ecosystem provide the habitat heterogeneity necessary for adequate food, denning, and cover resources.  Because there are limited opportunities to increase or control these habitat components, the objective for grizzly bear habitat management has been and continues to be to reduce or mitigate the risk of human-caused mortality and displacement.  An effective habitat management tool for reducing grizzly bear mortality risk on public lands is managing motorized access to ensure bears have secure areas away from humans.  Unmanaged motorized access:  (1) increases human interaction and potential grizzly bear mortality risk; (2) increases displacement from important habitat; (3) increases habituation to humans; and (4) decreases habitat where energetic (i.e., food) requirements can be met.  Managing motorized access on public lands helps ameliorate these impacts.  Other habitat management tools that minimize displacement and reduce grizzly bear mortality risk include regulating livestock allotments and developed sites on public lands.  Implementing food storage orders on public lands also reduces mortality risk for both humans and grizzly bears.  Requiring users and recreationists in grizzly bear habitat to store their food, garbage, and other bear attractants so that they are inaccessible to bears reduces encounters and human-grizzly bear conflicts.  In addition, encouraging users and recreationists to carry bear spray and know how to use it helps reduce the potential for injury to people and bears. ",

      "habitatRequirements": "Samuels Song Sparrows are an abundant resident in salt marshes in their described distribution. In a typical San Pablo Bay marsh, sparrow territories are lined single file every 10 to 50 m along channels, providing each pair with access to the slough and its associated tall vegetation for song perches and nesting cover. Dense vegetation is required for nesting sites for all Song Sparrows. Where vegetation is too short and sparse, Samuels Song Sparrows nests are more likely to be exposed to predators or flooding during high tides. The dominant plants of tidal salt marshes in San Pablo Bay, which may be used in the construction of nests, are California Cord Grass (Spartina foliosa) in low elevations, Pickleweed (Salicornia virginica) at higher elevations, and Gumplant (Grindelia stricta) on the highest ground along slough edges and levees.",

The plumage is white except for black primaries and secondaries and a short black tail. The head and neck are largely unfeathered and dark gray in color. The bill is black, thick at the base, and slightly decurved. Immature birds are dingy gray and have a yellowish bill. \n",
      "habitatRequirements": "The southeast United States breeding population of the wood stork declined from an estimated 20,000 pairs in the 1930's to about 10,000 pairs by 1960, and to a low of approximately 5,000 pairs in the late 1970s.  Nesting primarily occurred in the Everglades.  The generally accepted explanation for the decline of the wood stork is the reduction in food base (primarly small fish) necessary to support breeding colonies.  This reduction is attributed to loss of wetland habitat as well as to changes in water hydroperiods from draining wetlands and changing water regimes by constructing levees, canals, and floodgates to alter water flow in south Florida.\n\nWood storks have a unique feeding technique and require higher prey concentrations than other wading birds.  Optimal water regimes for the wood stork involve periods of flooding, during which prey (fish) populations increase, alternating with dryer periods, during which receding water levels concentrate fish at higher densities coinciding with the stork's nesting season.  Loss of nesting habitat (primarily cypress swamps) may be affecting wood storks in central Florida, where nesting in non-native trees and in man-made impoundments has been occurring recently.  Less significant factors known to affect nesting success include prolonged drought and flooding, raccoon predation on nests, and human disturbance of rookeries.",

Hind feet have four toes and its laterally white-striped, thick tail has a conspicuous white tuft of hair on the tip and is about 160 percent of the length of the body (Merriam 1894, p. 110) (Figure 2.1). OrdÂ’s kangaroo rat, (Dipodomys ordii), the only other kangaroo rat in the TKR range, is smaller, lacks the long white hairs at the tip of the tail, has five toes on the hind feet, and lives in sandy soil uncharacteristic of TKR habitat (Dalquest and Collier 1964, p. 148; Martin 2002, p. 2). Like other Dipodomys spp., both male and female TKR possess skin glands dorsally between the shoulders, which communicate sexual receptivity (Stangl et al. 2006, p. 466). The body is relatively large averaging 120 millimeters (mm) (4.7 inches (in)) in length. The upper body is a pale yellow-brown color with blackish guard hairs and the underside of the animal is white. The nearly hairless ears are small and the eyes relatively large. The sexes are superficially indistinguishable (Strassman 2004, p. 2); however, males may be generally larger than females, especially on the eastern and western margins of their range (Best 1987, p. 57). External measurements average: total length, 317 mm (12.5 in); tail, 196 mm (7.7 in); hind foot, 46 mm (1.8 in) (Schmidly 2004, p. 366). TKR use their long hind feet for saltatorial (jumping) locomotion and escaping predators (Genoways and Brown 1993, p. 297).",
      "habitatRequirements": "Habitat that supports the Texas kangaroo rat's life history generally includes an accumulation of loose, friable soil, usually associated with a minor topographic uplift (e.g., prairie mounds) or physical support, including woody vegetation (e.g., roots of shrubs and cacti) and other natural (e.g., rocks, upturned rootballs) or manmade structures. A common characteristic of TKR habitat is the presence of bare ground and short grasses, often expressed as a lack of dense vegetation. The TKR digs a subterranean burrow system within loam/clay-loam/sandy-loam soils with multiple chambers branching from the main tunnel, which are used for shelter, reproduction, and food storage. Resource needs for individual TKR generally include: friable, loam/clay-loam soil for burrowing, predominately grasses and forbs for a food source, short grass prairie with bare ground and limited woody cover, and topographic relief not prone to flooding events.\r\n",

      "speciesDescription": "Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) are generally larger and heavier than other bears. Adult males average 200 to 300 kilograms (kg) (400 to 600 pounds (lb)) and adult females 110 to 160 kg (250 to 350 lb) in the lower-48 States. Their coloration varies from light brown to nearly black. They can be distinguished from black bears by longer, less curved front claws, humped shoulders, and a facial profile that appears concace. The coat features longer guard hairs over a dense underfur with tips that are usually silver or golden in color Â– hence the name Â“grizzly.Â” Grizzly bears are long-lived mammals, generally living into their mid- to late-20s, although some wild bears have lived for over 35 years. Grizzly bears are a member of the brown bear species (U. arctos) that occurs in North America, Europe, and Asia. The subspecies U. a. horribilis is limited to North America and historically existed throughout much of the western half of the lower-48 States, central Mexico, western Canada, and most of Alaska. Prior to 1800, an estimated 50,000 grizzly bears were distributed in one large contiguous area throughout all or portions of 18 the westernmost States. Grizzly bears were probably most common in the Rocky Mountains, along the Upper Missouri River, and in California. Grizzly bears were less common or did not occur in large expanses of the North American deserts and Great Plains ecoregions. With the arrival of Europeans to North America, grizzly bears were seen as a threat to livestock and human safety and, therefore, an impediment to westward expansion and settlement. In the 1800s, in concert with European settlement of the American West and government-funded bounty programs aimed at eradication, grizzly bears were shot, poisoned, and trapped wherever they were found. The resulting declines in range and population were dramatic with rapid extinction of populations from Mexico and most of the central and southwestern United States and California. Grizzly bears were reduced to close to 2 percent of their former range in the lower-48 States by the 1930s, with a corresponding decrease in population. By 1975, grizzly bear populations in the lower-48 States had been reduced in number to 700Â–800 and restricted largely to the confines of National Parks and Wilderness areas in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. The 1993 Recovery Plan identified six ecosystems, with recovery zones at the core of each, to further recovery efforts. Each recovery zone represents an area large enough and of sufficient habitat quality to support a recovered grizzly bear population. The Recovery Plan recognized that grizzly bears will move and reside permanently in areas outside the recovery zones and that movement between recovery areas would be necessary for isolated populations to increase and sustain themselves at recovery levels. The recovery zones identified are: (1) the Greater Yellowstone (GYE) in northwestern Wyoming, eastern Idaho, and southwestern Montana; (2) the Northern Continental Divide (NCDE) of north-central Montana; (3) the North Cascades area of north-central Washington; (4) the Selkirks (SE) area of northern Idaho, northeast Washington, and southeast B.C.; (5) the Cabinet-Yaak (CYE) area of northwestern Montana and northern Idaho; and (6) the Bitterroot (BE) in the Bitterroot Mountains of central Idaho and western Montana. Currently, there are at least 1,913 individuals in the lower-48 States (737 in the GYE demographic monitoring area, 1,068 in the NCDE, 55Â–60 in the CYE, and a minimum of 53 in the U.S. portion of the SE, although some bears have home ranges that cross the international border). In addition, grizzly bears have been verified in areas outside of current distributions; however, there are likely few resident grizzly bears in the lower-48 States outside of the GYE, NCDE, CYE, and SE. There are currently no known populations within the North Cascades and BE.",
      "habitatRequirements": "Grizzly bears use a variety of habitats.  In general, a grizzly bearÂ’s individual habitat needs and daily movements are largely driven by the search for food, water, mates, cover, security, or den sites.  The available habitat for bears is also influenced by people and their activities.  Human activities are the primary factor impacting habitat security and the ability of bears to find and access foods, mates, cover, and den sites.  Other factors influencing habitat use and function for grizzly bears include overall habitat productivity (e.g., food distribution, quality, and abundance), the availability of habitat components (e.g., denning areas, cover types), grizzly bear social dynamics, learned behavior and preferences of individual grizzly bears, grizzly bear population density, and random variation.  Water is an important habitat requirement; however, we have no information to suggest that water is limiting in the habitat that bears currently occupy, but may have limited distribution in portions of historical range.\r\n\r\nGrizzly bears use a variety of cover types to rest and shelter.  Grizzly bears often select bed sites with horizontal and vertical cover, especially at day bed sites suggesting that bed site selection is important for concealment from humans.  The interspersion of open areas as feeding sites associated with cover are important, probably because diverse habitat complexes, such as forest interspersed with moist grass-forb meadows, provide both abundant food and cover.  Generally, areas with vegetative cover are important to grizzly bears for use as bedding sites.  Beds underneath any type of vegetative cover (not necessarily always forest cover) provide bears shade during the hottest parts of the day and a place to sleep at night.\r\n\r\nThe six ecosystems occur in mountainous ecoregions and each ecosystem provide the habitat heterogeneity necessary for adequate food, denning, and cover resources.  Because there are limited opportunities to increase or control these habitat components, the objective for grizzly bear habitat management has been and continues to be to reduce or mitigate the risk of human-caused mortality and displacement.  An effective habitat management tool for reducing grizzly bear mortality risk on public lands is managing motorized access to ensure bears have secure areas away from humans.  Unmanaged motorized access:  (1) increases human interaction and potential grizzly bear mortality risk; (2) increases displacement from important habitat; (3) increases habituation to humans; and (4) decreases habitat where energetic (i.e., food) requirements can be met.  Managing motorized access on public lands helps ameliorate these impacts.  Other habitat management tools that minimize displacement and reduce grizzly bear mortality risk include regulating livestock allotments and developed sites on public lands.  Implementing food storage orders on public lands also reduces mortality risk for both humans and grizzly bears.  Requiring users and recreationists in grizzly bear habitat to store their food, garbage, and other bear attractants so that they are inaccessible to bears reduces encounters and human-grizzly bear conflicts.  In addition, encouraging users and recreationists to carry bear spray and know how to use it helps reduce the potential for injury to people and bears. ",

      "habitatRequirements": "Samuels Song Sparrows are an abundant resident in salt marshes in their described distribution. In a typical San Pablo Bay marsh, sparrow territories are lined single file every 10 to 50 m along channels, providing each pair with access to the slough and its associated tall vegetation for song perches and nesting cover. Dense vegetation is required for nesting sites for all Song Sparrows. Where vegetation is too short and sparse, Samuels Song Sparrows nests are more likely to be exposed to predators or flooding during high tides. The dominant plants of tidal salt marshes in San Pablo Bay, which may be used in the construction of nests, are California Cord Grass (Spartina foliosa) in low elevations, Pickleweed (Salicornia virginica) at higher elevations, and Gumplant (Grindelia stricta) on the highest ground along slough edges and levees.",

      "speciesDescription": "Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) are generally larger and heavier than other bears. Adult males average 200 to 300 kilograms (kg) (400 to 600 pounds (lb)) and adult females 110 to 160 kg (250 to 350 lb) in the lower-48 States. Their coloration varies from light brown to nearly black. They can be distinguished from black bears by longer, less curved front claws, humped shoulders, and a facial profile that appears concace. The coat features longer guard hairs over a dense underfur with tips that are usually silver or golden in color Â– hence the name Â“grizzly.Â” Grizzly bears are long-lived mammals, generally living into their mid- to late-20s, although some wild bears have lived for over 35 years. Grizzly bears are a member of the brown bear species (U. arctos) that occurs in North America, Europe, and Asia. The subspecies U. a. horribilis is limited to North America and historically existed throughout much of the western half of the lower-48 States, central Mexico, western Canada, and most of Alaska. Prior to 1800, an estimated 50,000 grizzly bears were distributed in one large contiguous area throughout all or portions of 18 the westernmost States. Grizzly bears were probably most common in the Rocky Mountains, along the Upper Missouri River, and in California. Grizzly bears were less common or did not occur in large expanses of the North American deserts and Great Plains ecoregions. With the arrival of Europeans to North America, grizzly bears were seen as a threat to livestock and human safety and, therefore, an impediment to westward expansion and settlement. In the 1800s, in concert with European settlement of the American West and government-funded bounty programs aimed at eradication, grizzly bears were shot, poisoned, and trapped wherever they were found. The resulting declines in range and population were dramatic with rapid extinction of populations from Mexico and most of the central and southwestern United States and California. Grizzly bears were reduced to close to 2 percent of their former range in the lower-48 States by the 1930s, with a corresponding decrease in population. By 1975, grizzly bear populations in the lower-48 States had been reduced in number to 700Â–800 and restricted largely to the confines of National Parks and Wilderness areas in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. The 1993 Recovery Plan identified six ecosystems, with recovery zones at the core of each, to further recovery efforts. Each recovery zone represents an area large enough and of sufficient habitat quality to support a recovered grizzly bear population. The Recovery Plan recognized that grizzly bears will move and reside permanently in areas outside the recovery zones and that movement between recovery areas would be necessary for isolated populations to increase and sustain themselves at recovery levels. The recovery zones identified are: (1) the Greater Yellowstone (GYE) in northwestern Wyoming, eastern Idaho, and southwestern Montana; (2) the Northern Continental Divide (NCDE) of north-central Montana; (3) the North Cascades area of north-central Washington; (4) the Selkirks (SE) area of northern Idaho, northeast Washington, and southeast B.C.; (5) the Cabinet-Yaak (CYE) area of northwestern Montana and northern Idaho; and (6) the Bitterroot (BE) in the Bitterroot Mountains of central Idaho and western Montana. Currently, there are at least 1,913 individuals in the lower-48 States (737 in the GYE demographic monitoring area, 1,068 in the NCDE, 55Â–60 in the CYE, and a minimum of 53 in the U.S. portion of the SE, although some bears have home ranges that cross the international border). In addition, grizzly bears have been verified in areas outside of current distributions; however, there are likely few resident grizzly bears in the lower-48 States outside of the GYE, NCDE, CYE, and SE. There are currently no known populations within the North Cascades and BE.",
      "habitatRequirements": "Grizzly bears use a variety of habitats.  In general, a grizzly bearÂ’s individual habitat needs and daily movements are largely driven by the search for food, water, mates, cover, security, or den sites.  The available habitat for bears is also influenced by people and their activities.  Human activities are the primary factor impacting habitat security and the ability of bears to find and access foods, mates, cover, and den sites.  Other factors influencing habitat use and function for grizzly bears include overall habitat productivity (e.g., food distribution, quality, and abundance), the availability of habitat components (e.g., denning areas, cover types), grizzly bear social dynamics, learned behavior and preferences of individual grizzly bears, grizzly bear population density, and random variation.  Water is an important habitat requirement; however, we have no information to suggest that water is limiting in the habitat that bears currently occupy, but may have limited distribution in portions of historical range.\r\n\r\nGrizzly bears use a variety of cover types to rest and shelter.  Grizzly bears often select bed sites with horizontal and vertical cover, especially at day bed sites suggesting that bed site selection is important for concealment from humans.  The interspersion of open areas as feeding sites associated with cover are important, probably because diverse habitat complexes, such as forest interspersed with moist grass-forb meadows, provide both abundant food and cover.  Generally, areas with vegetative cover are important to grizzly bears for use as bedding sites.  Beds underneath any type of vegetative cover (not necessarily always forest cover) provide bears shade during the hottest parts of the day and a place to sleep at night.\r\n\r\nThe six ecosystems occur in mountainous ecoregions and each ecosystem provide the habitat heterogeneity necessary for adequate food, denning, and cover resources.  Because there are limited opportunities to increase or control these habitat components, the objective for grizzly bear habitat management has been and continues to be to reduce or mitigate the risk of human-caused mortality and displacement.  An effective habitat management tool for reducing grizzly bear mortality risk on public lands is managing motorized access to ensure bears have secure areas away from humans.  Unmanaged motorized access:  (1) increases human interaction and potential grizzly bear mortality risk; (2) increases displacement from important habitat; (3) increases habituation to humans; and (4) decreases habitat where energetic (i.e., food) requirements can be met.  Managing motorized access on public lands helps ameliorate these impacts.  Other habitat management tools that minimize displacement and reduce grizzly bear mortality risk include regulating livestock allotments and developed sites on public lands.  Implementing food storage orders on public lands also reduces mortality risk for both humans and grizzly bears.  Requiring users and recreationists in grizzly bear habitat to store their food, garbage, and other bear attractants so that they are inaccessible to bears reduces encounters and human-grizzly bear conflicts.  In addition, encouraging users and recreationists to carry bear spray and know how to use it helps reduce the potential for injury to people and bears. ",

Hind feet have four toes and its laterally white-striped, thick tail has a conspicuous white tuft of hair on the tip and is about 160 percent of the length of the body (Merriam 1894, p. 110) (Figure 2.1). OrdÂ’s kangaroo rat, (Dipodomys ordii), the only other kangaroo rat in the TKR range, is smaller, lacks the long white hairs at the tip of the tail, has five toes on the hind feet, and lives in sandy soil uncharacteristic of TKR habitat (Dalquest and Collier 1964, p. 148; Martin 2002, p. 2). Like other Dipodomys spp., both male and female TKR possess skin glands dorsally between the shoulders, which communicate sexual receptivity (Stangl et al. 2006, p. 466). The body is relatively large averaging 120 millimeters (mm) (4.7 inches (in)) in length. The upper body is a pale yellow-brown color with blackish guard hairs and the underside of the animal is white. The nearly hairless ears are small and the eyes relatively large. The sexes are superficially indistinguishable (Strassman 2004, p. 2); however, males may be generally larger than females, especially on the eastern and western margins of their range (Best 1987, p. 57). External measurements average: total length, 317 mm (12.5 in); tail, 196 mm (7.7 in); hind foot, 46 mm (1.8 in) (Schmidly 2004, p. 366). TKR use their long hind feet for saltatorial (jumping) locomotion and escaping predators (Genoways and Brown 1993, p. 297).",
      "habitatRequirements": "Habitat that supports the Texas kangaroo rat's life history generally includes an accumulation of loose, friable soil, usually associated with a minor topographic uplift (e.g., prairie mounds) or physical support, including woody vegetation (e.g., roots of shrubs and cacti) and other natural (e.g., rocks, upturned rootballs) or manmade structures. A common characteristic of TKR habitat is the presence of bare ground and short grasses, often expressed as a lack of dense vegetation. The TKR digs a subterranean burrow system within loam/clay-loam/sandy-loam soils with multiple chambers branching from the main tunnel, which are used for shelter, reproduction, and food storage. Resource needs for individual TKR generally include: friable, loam/clay-loam soil for burrowing, predominately grasses and forbs for a food source, short grass prairie with bare ground and limited woody cover, and topographic relief not prone to flooding events.\r\n",

      "speciesDescription": "Wood storks are large, long-legged wading birds, about 5O inches tall, with a wingspan of 60 to 65 inches. The plumage is white except for black primaries and secondaries and a short black tail. The head and neck are largely unfeathered and dark gray in color. The bill is black, thick at the base, and slightly decurved. Immature birds are dingy gray and have a yellowish bill. \n",
      "habitatRequirements": "The southeast United States breeding population of the wood stork declined from an estimated 20,000 pairs in the 1930's to about 10,000 pairs by 1960, and to a low of approximately 5,000 pairs in the late 1970s.  Nesting primarily occurred in the Everglades.  The generally accepted explanation for the decline of the wood stork is the reduction in food base (primarly small fish) necessary to support breeding colonies.  This reduction is attributed to loss of wetland habitat as well as to changes in water hydroperiods from draining wetlands and changing water regimes by constructing levees, canals, and floodgates to alter water flow in south Florida.\n\nWood storks have a unique feeding technique and require higher prey concentrations than other wading birds.  Optimal water regimes for the wood stork involve periods of flooding, during which prey (fish) populations increase, alternating with dryer periods, during which receding water levels concentrate fish at higher densities coinciding with the stork's nesting season.  Loss of nesting habitat (primarily cypress swamps) may be affecting wood storks in central Florida, where nesting in non-native trees and in man-made impoundments has been occurring recently.  Less significant factors known to affect nesting success include prolonged drought and flooding, raccoon predation on nests, and human disturbance of rookeries.",

      "habitatRequirements": "The basic requirements of the Channel Island Song Sparrow are very similar to those described for mainland Song Sparrows: moderately dense scrubby vegetation for nesting, escape cover, and foraging; a source of standing or running water or, in dry scrub habitats, constant moisture from fog or dew; adequate light; and exposed ground or leaf litter for foraging. Song sparrows at San Miguel construct compact, open nest bowls of twigs, herbs, parts of shrubs, weed stems, grass stems, and dry leaves, lining them with fine grasses. The nest is typically constructed deep within the nest plant, where they are concealed from island fox predation. This subspecies also tends to build heavier nests and locate them on the leeward side of a shrub due to wind.",

      "habitatRequirements": "The basic requirements of the Channel Island Song Sparrow are very similar to those described for mainland Song Sparrows: moderately dense scrubby vegetation for nesting, escape cover, and foraging; a source of standing or running water or, in dry scrub habitats, constant moisture from fog or dew; adequate light; and exposed ground or leaf litter for foraging. Song sparrows at San Miguel construct compact, open nest bowls of twigs, herbs, parts of shrubs, weed stems, grass stems, and dry leaves, lining them with fine grasses. The nest is typically constructed deep within the nest plant, where they are concealed from island fox predation. This subspecies also tends to build heavier nests and locate them on the leeward side of a shrub due to wind.",

      "habitatRequirements": "The basic requirements of the Channel Island Song Sparrow are very similar to those described for mainland Song Sparrows: moderately dense scrubby vegetation for nesting, escape cover, and foraging; a source of standing or running water or, in dry scrub habitats, constant moisture from fog or dew; adequate light; and exposed ground or leaf litter for foraging. Song sparrows at San Miguel construct compact, open nest bowls of twigs, herbs, parts of shrubs, weed stems, grass stems, and dry leaves, lining them with fine grasses. The nest is typically constructed deep within the nest plant, where they are concealed from island fox predation. This subspecies also tends to build heavier nests and locate them on the leeward side of a shrub due to wind.",

Song sparrows at San Miguel construct compact, open nest bowls of twigs, herbs, parts of shrubs, weed stems, grass stems, and dry leaves, lining them with fine grasses. The nest is typically constructed deep within the nest plant, where they are concealed from island fox predation.

Song sparrows at San Miguel construct compact, open nest bowls of twigs, herbs, parts of shrubs, weed stems, grass stems, and dry leaves, lining them with fine grasses. The nest is typically constructed deep within the nest plant, where they are concealed from island fox predation. This subspecies also tends to build heavier nests and locate them on the leeward side of a shrub due to wind.",

The Sage SparrowÂ’s under parts are mostly white with a contrasting much darker blackish, brown tail. The Sage Sparrow is also known for the frequent upward jerk of its tail and its light, metallic call. Juveniles are more streaked on the lower body than adults (Martin and Carlson 1998).\r\n<p><b>Citations:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Martin, John W. and Barbara A. Carlson. 1998.
